        <h2>Dot Esports: Razer’s global esports director is thinking bigger than “just Champion gamers”</h2>
        <p class="description">"We are authentic and passionate about what we do, and our priority is always about the community."</p>
        <p>There’s no denying the fan power of streamers and brands in the esports industry. Razer is one of those brands with a fanatic-like following. The company is so famous for its RGB products that there’s even a fan-made page calling for a Razer Toaster—something the company has alluded to many times but never confirmed.</p>
        <p>The obsession is about more than the RGB for esports fans, though. This week, Razer announced the Inaugural Southeast Asian Invitational—a three-game tournament set to follow the Southeast Asian Games. The event will bring together 10 top teams from SEA nations in a bid to help them prepare for the SEA Games in 2021.</p>
        <p>Following this announcement, Dot Esports talked with David Tse, the global esports director at Razer, about what motivates Razer to continue supporting the esports community and the company’s plans for the future.</p>
        <p>Recently, Razer has been thinking bigger than gaming and has started supplying countries with the resources and supplies required to combat COVID-19.</p>
        <p>Esports is probably the only sports that are not completely shut down at the moment. It (esports) continues to be a means of entertainment and engagement, either individually, as a family, or as part of the community during these challenging times when we spend most of our time at home.</p>
        <p>As Razer, we represent the community, and through the leadership of our CEO, Min-Liang Tan, we are able to do more to support many countries and our community.</p>
        <p>Team Razer, consisting of top teams and individual esports athletes globally, are seen as representatives to the esports community. Our esports athletes are a motivation to many in the community, and we have gathered 36 of them as advocates of Razer’s “Stay Home and Game On” campaign. </p>
