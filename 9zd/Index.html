        <h3>Products</h3>
        <p>Razer's products are generally targeted at gamers, and include gaming laptops, gaming tablets, and PC peripherals such as mice, audio devices, keyboards, mouse mats, and game pads. Razer has also released a VOIP software called Razer Comms. The Razer DeathAdder gaming mouse is the company's most popular product by sales numbers. Razer mice are used by around 5% of professional gamers.[30] Most Razer products are named after predatory or venomous animals, ranging from snakes (mice), insects (mouse mats), arachnids (keyboards), marine creatures (audio), and felines (console peripherals). The exceptions to this are the Razer Blade laptops and Razer Edge, which are instead named after bladed objects.[citation needed] Razer announced its first gaming smartphone, the Razer Phone, in November 2017, which marked the company's first steps into the smartphone business.</p>
        <p>In January 2021, Razer launched a range of high-grade designer masks as part of the company's initiative, Project Hazel, in a move to encourage more people to wear masks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The mask is designed to allow lip-reading and seeing facial cues when people talk, with LED lights to illuminate the wearer's face in dark environments. The same year it also entered the gaming chair market with the Iskur, an in-house designed chair for gaming.</p>
