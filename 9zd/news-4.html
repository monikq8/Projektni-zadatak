        <p>Enhancing in-game communications through its detachable Razer™ HyperClear Supercardioid Mic, the Razer Kaira Pro focuses on a tight vocal recognition pattern while suppressing unwanted background noise to achieve greater vocal clarity.</p>
        <p>The wireless headset also offers a built-in microphone for mobile usage, providing users the options to connect to their mobile devices through Bluetooth as well as the PS5™, PS4™, PC, and other devices that have a USB-C or USB-A port via an included 2.4 GHz USB-C Razer™ HyperSpeed Dongle (USB-A adapter included).</p>
        <p>Completing the PlayStation®5 headset line-up is the Razer Kaira Dual Wireless Headset. Whether on console or mobile, gamers can enjoy unrivalled convenience when gaming with Razer™ SmartSwitch, which allows for seamless switching between 2.4 GHz and Bluetooth devices.</p>
        <p>Also being announced today are the Razer Quick Charging Stands. The stands were thoughtfully designed in a range of matching colors to suit the galaxy-inspired PS5™ DualSense™ Wireless Controllers.</p>
        <p>The Razer Quick Charging Stand rapidly charges controllers to reach prime power levels in under 3 hours and ensures minimal gaming downtime for PS5™ users. It is available in White, Black and Red colors to achieve a seamless look.</p>
